## Dosage

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

Five (5) nanograms of Myrcene per deciliter of blood is all it takes to attenuate the synergy between #THC (or, #CBD) and the myrcene molecule.

So, a glass of pure Mango juice crushed to include the skin of the fruit, but not the seed of the tree will suffice.

**Note**. Acetaminophen (tylenol) is a liver carcinogen in the lab. Whereas, B-Myrcene is liver protective.
