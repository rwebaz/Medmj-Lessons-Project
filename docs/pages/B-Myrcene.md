## Dosage

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

Five (5) nanograms of Myrcene per deciliter of blood is all it takes to attenuate the synergy between #THC (or, #CBD) and the myrcene molecule.

So, a glass of pure Mango juice crushed to include the skin of the fruit, but not the seed of the tree will suffice.

**Note**. Acetaminophen (tylenol) is a liver carcinogen in the lab. Whereas, B-Myrcene is liver protective.

## Sativas v Indicas

There are many other terpenes (150) and cannabinoids (150) in the trichomes of the Cannabis plant.

However, Sativas (as opposed to Indicas) tend to have the highest levels of Beta-myrcene.
