## Medical Cannabis in Missouri

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

### Guidelines

The new Missouri Medical Marijuana Guidelines, or MMG-MO were debated and promulgated during the time frame of Thirty (30) days after the successful passing of `Amendment 2` by a 66% plurality of Missouri voters at the mid-term election of #2018 up to and including the calendar year end of December 31st, 2019.

As a result of the passage, the language from the petition was carried over as an amendment to the 4th Missouri State Constitution of 1945, or 4MSC - 1945.

Therefore, `Amendment 2` is now known as Article XIV (14) of 4MSC - 1945, as amended.

### State Law Precedent

Where state law PRECEDENT to Amendment XIV, 4MSC - 1945 is deemed to be superior ...

Or, when a private contract between two or more parties would otherwise prohibit an `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility` ...

In the absence of a reasonable effort by the prevailing parties to accommodate the provisions of Amendment XIV, 4MSC - 1945 given a reasonable request by the Qualified Medical Patient, or QMP ...

Then, this Amendment language and its accompanying guidelines shall severably hold.

### Effective Date

The date of effectiveness of the passed initiative is Thirty (30) days after the successful passing of `Amendment 2` on November 6th, 2018 or December 6th, 2018.

### Article XIV (14)

As a result of the passage of `Amendment 2`, the following guidelines were enacted ...

1.) `Amendment 2` is now an Article to the 4th Missouri State Constitution of 1945, or 4MSC - 1945 and is now known as Amendment XIV (14) of 4MSC - 1945.

See: Missouri Article XIV (14), 4th MO Constitution of 1945, Section 1 plus all Subsections, as amended by the Voters of Missouri on November 6th, 2018 [[4](#JOHNASHCROFT){:.red}]

**Source**: Subsection 9.01 of the Rules of the MO Department of Health and Senior Services [[1](#MORULESLAND){:.red}]

### Ballot Language

The language carried over from the text of `Amendment 2` is included within the set of guidelines issued by the the MO Division of Health and Senior Services.

The original ballot language of the proposal had the words of the initiative placed within a new section of the 4th Missouri Constitution of 1945 under a new Article XVI, or Sixteen (16).

However, the words of the initiative were subsequently renumbered by the Missouri Secretary of State during the updated publication of the 4th Missouri Constitution of 1945, as amended, in January of 2019.

As a result, a new Article XIV, or Fourteen (14) titled "Medical Cannabis", or Medmj also starting with a Section One (1) became effective on December 6th, 2018, thirty (30) days after the date of the adoption of the proposal by the voters of Missouri.

The new `Missouri Medical Marijuana Guidelines`, or MMG-MO were debated and promulgated by the MO Division of Health and Senior Services during the time frame of Thirty (30) days after the successful passing of `Amendment 2` by a 66% majority of Missouri voters in the mid-term election of November 6th, 2018 up to and including the calendar year end of December 31st, 2019.

### Private Contracts

In the absence of a reasonable effort by the parties to the private contract to accommodate the provisions of Amendment XIV, 4MSC - 1945 given a reasonable request by the QMP ...

This amendment shall hold, or shall not hold.

In Missouri, under the new Medical Marijuana guidelines debated and promulgated by the MO Division of Health and Senior Services ...

## Flowers Are Key

Dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers are defined in Missouri as the FLOWERING parts of the plant AFTER the flower buds and brachts have been sufficiently cured and trimmed.

There is no mention of un-processed "shake" in the initiative.

Therefore, are we to assume leaves and stems, and other non-flowering parts of the Cannabis plant of any given type are not countable towards the monthly possession limit?

Answer: Correct!

### Growing-Your-Own Medicine

The State of Missouri differentiates between Clone-stage plants and Vegetative-stage plants and medicinally Flowering-stage plants.

#### Plant Quotas

Each Qualified Medical Patient, or QMP in Missouri may grow either indoors internally or outdoors externally a total of Six (6) Clone-stage plants plus Six (6) Vegetative-stage plants plus Six (6) Flowering-stage plants with or without the help of a Licensed Care Provider, or LCP as long as the growing is performed within a registered `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility` and the QMP pony's up an extra $100 USD at registration time.

The standard allotment for a QMP is a total of Eighteen (18) plants, as follows:

a.) Six (6) plants from the Clone-stage category, plus

b.) Six (6) plants from the Vegetative-stage category, plus

c.) Six (6) plants from the Flowering-stage category.

#### Cultivation Fees

An extra $100 USD fee at the time of application is required to become a Qualified Medical Patient, or QMP in possession of an 'Authority to Cultivate'.

Thereafter annually at re-certification time, the QMP will be required to tender an updated medical certification, a $25 fee for the "Green Card", and the extra $100 USD fee to maintain the QMP's 'Authority to Cultivate'.

Please note an increase or decrease in the fees may occur based on any change in the Consumer Price Index, either upwards or downwards.

### Processed Flowers

#### Key Measurements

a.) One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers is the equivalent of Eight (8) grams of `Medical Marijuana Concentrate`, or MedMj-C.

b.) One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers is also the equivalent of an aggregate Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of infused delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol, or THC as is present nominally by weight in the majority of most medicinally infused products.

## Plant Types

The State of Missouri differentiates between Vegetative stage plants and medicinally Flowering stage plants, as well as Clone stage plants.

The Three (3) main types of Cannabis plants in Missouri in addition to the Hemp plant are, as follows:

a.) Clone-stage plants,

b.) Vegetative-stage plants, and

c.) Flowering-stage plants.

### Clone Stage Plants

A Clone-stage plant is defined as a Cannabis plant of no more than Fourteen (14) inches in height from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem, and is normally kept so by topping and an artificial lighting period of greater than Twelve (12) hours per Twenty-four (24) day as to not induce the flowering stage of the plant.

### Vegetation Stage Plants

A Vegetation-stage plant is defined as a Cannabis plant of more than Fourteen (14) inches in height from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem, and is normally kept so by topping and an artificial lighting period of less than Twelve (12) hours of continuous darkness per Twenty-four (24) period as to not induce the flowering stage of the plant.

**Note.** A Vegetation-stage plant is a plant that has progressed in growth beyond its original Clone-stage in height and may also be a plant of any height that is not currently flowering that was once originally started with an achene.

### Flowering Stage Plants

A Flowering-stage plant is defined as a Cannabis plant of unlimited inches in height from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem, and is normally kept so by controlled growth under an artificial lighting period of no more than Twelve (12) hours of continuous light per Twenty-four (24) hour period as to INDUCE the flowering stage of the plant.

**Note.** There is no size limit for a medicinally Flowering Cannabis plant in Missouri either indoors or outdoors as long as the plant is kept within a registered `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility`.

### Auto-flower Plants

An Auto-flower plant can also be less than or more than Fourteen (14) inches tall from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem, as well.

However, the moment an Auto-flower plant starts to flower it then moves the plant into the category of a medicinally Flowering plant irregardless of its height measurement.

There is no natural photo-period requirement for an Auto-flower veggie plant to begin its flowering stage.

**Note.** A medicinally Flowering plant in Missouri is defined as a Cannabis plant that has begun to exhibit the first signs of its sexual maturity.

## Medical Marijuana Concentrates

For purchase and possession limitations, One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers is equivalent to Eight (8) grams of processed `Medical Marijuana Concentrate`, or MedMj-C.

### Infused Products

For purchase and possession limitations, One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers as defined above is also the equivalent of Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of processed and infused delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC products.

For example, if you dose Eight (8) cupcakes with a splash of One-hundred (100) milligrams of concentrated THC liquid each, then you have reached the equivalent of One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers.

## Purchase and Possession

The State of Missouri allows a standard Qualifying Medical Patient, or QMP to possess a stash equal to a Sixty (60) day supply of Cannabis medicine.

### Limitations

If the monthly possession limit for a QMP is a minimum of Four (4) ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers as allotted by their physician ...

Then, a QMP can be in possession of Four (4) ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers times two.

Or,

Four (4) ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers plus (8) grams of `Medical Marijuana Concentrate` times four.

Or,

Four (4) ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers plus Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC in the form of a discreet number of infused products times four.

Or,

Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC in the form of a discreet number of infused products times eight.

Or,

Eight (8) grams of `Medical Marijuana Concentrate` times eight.

Confusing?

Just remember to add up your ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers plus your concentrate and infused product equivalents.

And, don't go over the Sixty (60) day supply limit of Eight (8) ounces without a letter from TWO physicians stating you meed MORE than the standard allotment to deal with your ailment.

#### Extra Allotments

Unless, of course, you have registered an `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility`.

In such case, the QMP is allowed to stash up to a Ninety (90) day supply, or Twelve (12) ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers or its equivalent in any combination that does not exceed the "extra"  Thirty (30) days of Cannabis medicine allowed.

**Note.** All stashing must be done at the same location registered as the `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility`.

### Calculating Concentrate

One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers is the equivalent of Eight (8) grams of `Medical Marijuana Concentrate`, or MedMj-C.

And,

One (1) ounce of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers is the equivalent of Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC infused products.

### Dosing Cupcakes

If each medicinal power bar or cupcake is infused with One-hundred (100) milligrams of pure delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC, for example ...

Then the QMP can be in possession of a box of Eight (8) times Eight-hundred (800) or Sixty-four (64) bars or a box of Sixty-four (64) cupcakes, or any combination of the two that sums to Sixty-four hundred (6400) milligrams of delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC infused products.

**Note.** Sixty-four hundred (6400) milligrams of delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC infused products are equal to a Sixty (60) days supply of Eight (8) ounces of dried, un-processed Cannabis flowers at the rate of Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol THC infused products per ounce.

## Pods O Three

In the case where Two (2) QMPs and their Licensed Care Provider, or LCP utilize the same cultivation location, then a limit of Eighteen (18) plants times Three (3) persons, or a total of Fifty-four (54) plants of all types shall prevail.

### Enclosed Locked Facilities

An enclosed, locked facility can simply be an indoor, stationary closet equipped with locks or some other type of functioning security device that permits access only to the Qualifying Medical Patient, or QMP and to his or her Licensed Care Provider, or LCP or to his or her Secondary Registered Care Provider, or SRCP.

#### 54 Plant Max Limit

In the case where Two (2) QMPs and their Licensed Care Provider, or LCP utilize the same cultivation location, then a limit of Fifty-four (54) plants of all plant types shall prevail for the registered `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility`, as follows:

1.) Six (6) Clone-type plants times Three (3) QMPs equals Eighteen (18) Clone-type plants, plus

2.) Six (6) Vegetation-type plants times Three (3) QMPs equals Eighteen (18) Vegetation-type plants, plus

3.) Six (6) Flowering-type plants times Three (3) QMPs, equals Eighteen (18) Flowering-type plants.

For a maximum total plant count of Fifty-four (54) plants per registered `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility`.

**Note.** An LCP can technically have a maximum of Three (3) QMPs registered to his or her provider number. However, a registered `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility` may only have one address and Two (2) QMPs if the LCP is also growing medicine for his or her self, as well as the Two (2) subject QMPs within the subject registered `Enclosed and Locked Private Cultivation Facility`.
