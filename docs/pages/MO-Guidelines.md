## MMG-MO

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

The new Missouri Medical Marijuana Guidelines, or MMG-MO were debated and promulgated by the MO Division of Health and Senior Services during the time frame of Thirty (30) days after the successful passing of Amendment 2 by a 66% majority of Missouri voters in the mid-term election of November 7th, 2018 up to and including the calendar year end of December 31st, 2019.

### Date of Effectiveness

The date of effectiveness of the passed initiative is Thirty (30) days after the successful passing of Amendment 2 by a 66% majority of Missouri voters in the mid-term election of November 7th, 2018 or December 6th, 2018.

As a result of the passage of Amendment 2, the following guidelines were enacted.

### Language

The language carried over from the text of Amendment 2 is included within the set of guidelines issued by the the MO Division of Health and Senior Services.

Amendment 2 is now an amendment to the 4th Missouri State Constitution of 1945, or 4MSC - 1945 now known as Amendment XVI (16) of 4MSC - 1945.

## Flowers Are Key

Dried, un-processed marijuana (or, its equivalent) is hereby defined in Missouri as the FLOWERING parts of the plant AFTER the flower buds and brachts have been sufficiently cured and trimmed.

### Concentrate

Further, One (1) ounce of such dried, unprocessed marijuana as defined above shall be equivalent to Eight (8) grams of Medical Marijuana Concentrate, or MedMj-C.

#### Purchase and Possession Example A

Therefore, for the purposes of purchase and possession limitations, One (1) ounce of dried, unprocessed marijuana as defined above is equivalent to Eight (8) grams of Medical Marijuana Concentrate, or MedMj-C.

### Infused Products

In addition, One (1) ounce of dried, unprocessed marijuana as defined above can also be equivalent to an aggregate of Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of infused delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol (THC) as is present nominally in the majority of most medicinally infused products.

Therefore, for the purposes of purchase and possession limitations, One (1) ounce of dried, unprocessed marijuana as defined above is also equivalent to Eight-hundred (800) milligrams of infused delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol (THC) products.

#### Purchase and Possession Example B

For example, if each medicinal power bar or cupcake possessed is infused with (100) milligrams of pure delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol (THC), then the QMP can be in possession of a box of Sixteen (16) bars or a box of (16) cupcakes, or any combination of the two that sums to Sixteen-hundred (1600) milligrams of products infused with delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol (THC).

## Allowable Stash

The State of Missouri allows their Qualifying Medical Patients, or QMPs to possess a stash equal to a Sixty (60) day supply of Cannabis medicine.

### Minimum of Four Ounces

If the monthly alotment for a QMP is the minimum Four (4) ounces of dried, unprocessed marijuana as defined above and allotted by their physician, then a QMP could be in possession of not only Four (4) ounces of dried, unprocessed marijuana as defined above but also (16) grams of MedMj-C (Medical Marijuana Concentrate) as well as Sixteen-hundred (1600) milligrams of infused delta-9-Tetra-Hydro-Cannabinol (THC) products per the Sixty (60) day supply rule of Cannabis medicine stash granted each QMP.

## Growing-Your-Own Medicine

Each `QMP` in Missouri, for an extra $100 fee at the time of application and re-application annually thereafter, may grow either indoors or outdoors a total of Six (6) Vegetative stage plants and Six (6) medicinally Flowering plants plus Six (6) Clone stage plants with or without the help of a licensed careprovider.

### Veggie vs Medicinal

The State of Missouri differentiates between both Vegetative stage plants and medicinally Flowering stage plants as well as Clone stage plants.

As mentioned above, the QMP is granted a total allotment of Eighteen (18) plants, as follows:

Six (6) plants from the Vegetative stage category and Six (6) plants from the medicinally Flowering stage category plus Six (6) plants from the Clone category.

### Conventional Plants

A conventional Veggie plant can be less than and more than Fourteen (14) inches tall from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem and is normally kept so by topping and lighting greater than (12) hours per day as to not induce the flowering stage of the plant.

### Auto-flower Plants

Whereas, an auto-flower veggie plant can also be less than or more than Fourteen (14) inches tall from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem, as well.

However, the moment the auto-flower Veggie plant starts to flower it then moves the plant into the category of medicinally Flowering.

A medicinally Flowering plant is defined as a Cannabis plant that has begun to exhibit the first signs of sexual maturity.

**Note**. There is no natural photo-period requirement for an auto-flower veggie plant to begin its flowering stage.

### Medicinally Flowering Plants

There is no size limit for a medicinally Flowering Cannabis plant in Missouri, both indoors and outdoors.

The plant, however, must be grown within an enclosed, locked facility.

### Clones

A "clone" is defined as any Cannabis plant of no more than Fourteen (14) inches in height from its base at the top of its container sans its root system to the tip of its meristem and is normally kept so by topping and a lighting period of greater than (12) hours per Twenty-four (24) period as to not induce the flowering stage of the plant.

## Enclosed Locked Facilities

An enclosed, locked facility can simply be an indoor, stationary closet equipped with locks or some other type of functioning security device that permits access only to the qualifying patient or primary caregiver.

### 54 Max Limit

In the case where Two (2) QMPs and their registered careprovider utilize the same cultivation location, a limit of Eighteen (18) plants times Three (3) persons shall prevail, as follows:

#### Clone Stage

Eighteen (18) less than 14-inch Clone stage plants = Six (6) plants times Three (3) persons

#### Veggie Stage

Eighteen (18) greater than or less than 14-inch Veggie stage plants = Six (6) plants times Three (3) persons

#### Flower Stage

Eighteen (18) greater than or less than 14-inch medicinally Flowering plants = Six (6) plants times Three (3) persons

#### Grand Total

For a total plant count of Six (6) times Three (3) times Three (3), or Six (6) times Nine (9) equals Fifty-four (54) plants.

## State Law Precedent

Where state law PRECEDENT to Amendment XIV, 4MSC - 1945 is deemed to be superior or when a private contract would otherwise prohibit an enclosed locked cultivation facility ...

### Private Contracts

In the absence of a reasonable effort by the parties to the private contract to accommodate the provisions of Amendment XIV, 4MSC - 1945 given a reasonable request by the QMP ...

This amendment shall hold, or shall not hold.
