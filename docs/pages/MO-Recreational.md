## Point Comfort, Virginia

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

From the end of the civil war in 1865 until the end of World War II in 1945 was 45 + 35 = Eighty (80) years.

From the end of World War II in 1945 until the signing of the Civil Rights bill in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson was Twenty (20) years.

Sounds like we're making progress, eh?

Until you realize its been 2020 - 1965 = 35 + 20 = 65 years from today all the way back to LBJ's famous signing!

### Keep Rolling

Now, let's roll back a little bit further.

Let's go all the way back to the year 1619.

One (1) year before the famous Pilgrim landing in the year 1620 ... south of what today is known as Boston harbor.

In August of that year, in 1619, further south down the coast along the province of Virginia, named after the virgin Queen of England, QEI (Queen Elizabeth I) ...

At the location of a little spit of land reaching out into the Atlantic Ocean called Point Comfort,

Down the plank came our country's first batch of Negroe citizens ...

Courtesy of their then clutch of Dutch owners, of course!

The Negroe citizens were to be auctioned off to the owners of our first Tobacco farmers of Amerika, to be used as forced labor in our first Tobacco fields, a plant which had become highly desirable in England and in all of Europe for its fashionable, aristocratic, sociable qualities.

Tobacco pa fumar, anyone?

Did I mention folks "over there" where willing to pay up for "good" leaf, as well?

Sound familiar?

## The Road to One-hundred Fifty

Fast forward to today, in November of 2020, the citizens of another province of this great country, the former home of the Osage and Missouria tribes of native Americans ...

Here in the very center on the land and peoples at the confluence of the two great North American rivers,

We find ourselves voting this year on whether or not a "black" man or a "white" man or a "red" man shall be awarded a license to grow One-hundred fifty (150) Cannabis plants under a combination of artificial and natural greenhouse sunlight.

### Cost to Compete

The cost of the proposed "micro" license to grow up to One-hundred fifty (150) Cannabis plants is a Fifteen-hundred ($1,500) non-refundable cash deposit ...

Along with a complete and thorough application that will be scored by an independent 3rd party with alleged ties to the unaccredited, for-profit Oaksterdam college of California ...

For the benefit of the MO Dept of Health and Human Services and all persons well versed in the nuances of Cannabis application submission tests, that happen to be also taught for a fee at Oaksterdam college, of course!

Conflict of Interest anyone?

### Expected Applicants

Now, how many "micro" applications for greenhouses that will accommodate One-hundred Fifty (150) Cannabis plants do yo all think will be tendered in the year 2021?

This will be AFTER the initiative titled `IP 2020 - 128` aka the "Adult Usage" petition passes at the General Election of November 3rd, 2020.

(402) years after that first plank-walkin'!

Did you say ...

One-hundred (100)?

Or,

Two-hundred (200)?

Or,

300-hundred (300) applications?

Read on!

## Section One (1) Medical Regime

Now, you all do know we just ushered in the most sweeping, the most accommodative, the most legal of any other 'Medical Marijuana' regime in the country a-way back in November of #2018.

But, how many of THOSE applications were awarded "Macro" licenses to cultivate, dispense, infuse, transport, or test?

### Number of Awards

The State of Missouri through the MO Dept of Health and Human Services received over Two-thousand (2,266) applications for "Macro" licenses filed by at least Seven-hundred (700) separate and distinct groups of investors.

The MO Dept of Health and Human Services to date has awarded Sixty (60) "Macro" cultivation licenses, Eighty-six (86) "Macro" infused products licenses, and One-hundred Ninety-two (192) "Macro" dispensary licenses.

**Note**. Each "Macro" Cultivation facility license allows for the cultivation of up to Two-thousand Five-hundred (2,500) plants.

Datz a Lot-O-Dweeb!

## QMPs

Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945, as adopted and effective on December 6th, 2018, in Section One (1), Part Three (3) titled 'Creating Patient Access', Paragraph Twelve (12) states ...

A 'Qualifying Medical Patient', or QMP or his or her Licensed Primary Caregiver, or LPC may obtain a Twelve (12) month Identification Card, or ID stamped with an 'Authority to Cultivate' up to Six (6) Flowering-stage plants at a single location for exclusive usage by the underlying QMP in exchange for $100 cash.

### Physician Recommendation

A new or updated physician's certification is required for each and all subsequent Twelve (12) month periods.

### Updated Guidelines

The State of Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services has since issued guidelines that include a total allotment of Six (6) Vegetative-stage plants plus Six (6) Clone-stage plants for all QMPs, as well as the original petition language of Six (6) Flowering-stage plants in a memo dated December 31st, 2018.

#### Discussion

Some Qualified Medical Patients, or QMPs, have already ponied up to One-hundred and Forty-nine ($149) cash just to get their medical certifications from their doctors.

And, then the QMPs have to pay another $25 to the State of Missouri through the Dept of Health and Human Services just to obtain a One (1) year license to consume Cannabis.

Further, some Qualified Medical Patients, or QMPs have also paid an EXTRA One-hundred ($100) cash just to get the "optional" 'Authority to Cultivate' stamped on their annual license, as well.

#### License Extension

As a sweetener to all currently registered "Qualifying Medical Patients", or QMPs their license period is extended from One (1) year to Three (3) years under the language of the "new" petition.

No more ponying up each year to pay your doctor for another basic Four (4) ounce per month recommendation.

The 'Qualified Medical Patient', or QMP should save about Two-hundred and Fifty ($250) cash each year with this new provision.

## Section Two (2) Recreational Regime

The new subject measure allows for each "micro" license recipient to be "vertically integrated".

Which is just a fancy way of saying you can "grow" AND "dispense" AND "infuse" and "transport" and "test" your product directly for consumption by the consumer.

Or, you may sell your product through the wholesale market to other "Macro" or "micro" business entities.

Total Flexibility!

### Micro Business Facilities

How to Get An Application To Apply For a Missouri "micro" business (MMB) license?

By October 1st, 2021, or sooner, before Two-hundred Seventy (270) days AFTER the effective date of the passage of the "new" Section Two (2) language have expired, the MO Dept of Health and Human Services will be ready to issue Application blanks and also will allow the "Pre-filing" of the Non-refundable Fifteen-hundred ($1,500) Application fee.

#### Duration of MMB License

The license for a "Micro" Cultivation facility shall be for (3) years and shall run con-current with the new, updated Three (3) year QMP license.

### Plant Quantity Bump

Upon the effective date of the legislation, all 'Qualified Medical Patients', or QMPs with an 'Authority to Cultivate' will be able to bump their allotment from Six (6) Clone-stage plants to Nine (9) Clone-stage plants.

That's the original Six (6) 'Medical' Clone-stage plants offered by the Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services derived from the original 'Medical Marijuana' petition Section One (1) language of 2018 plus the new Three (3) 'Recreational' Clone-stage plants offered through the 'Recreational Marijuana' petition Section Two (2) language of 2020.

Also per the language offered through the 'Recreational Marijuana' Section Two (2) of 2020, the non-refundable fee to establish or renew an MMB increases to Two-thousand Five-hundred ($2,500) per year effective in Year Four (4) of the program starting in year 2025, or sooner depending on how fast the MO Dept of Health and Human Services can process and approve the applications for "micro" Cultivation facility licenses.

So, in Four (4) years after implementation, the language of the petition states the MO Dept of Health and Senior Services can jack up the fee by a grand, or One-thousand ($1,000) USD from the initial base fee of Fifteen-hundred ($1,500) cash.

### Single Ownership

You cannot be issued more than One (1) "micro" Cultivation facility license ...

Except in the case of a "micro" Cultivation facility license owner that wishes to apply for any of the then available "Macro" Cultivation facility licenses, if any, that may be offered by the MO Dept of Health and Human Services from time-to-time.

Once issued a license to engage in a "Macro" Cultivation facility, you cannot then re-apply and downshift for a "Micro" Cultivation facility license.

### Natural Persons Only

A "micro" Cultivation facility license must be originally majority-owned by a "natural" person as defined by the State of Missouri.

And, that "natural" person as defined by the State of Missouri must have lived in the State of Missouri as a resident for at least One (1) year prior to the application date.

### Separate Foundations

All "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses issued under the original Section One (1) of Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945 ...

And, all "micro" vertically integrated Cultivation facility licenses issued under Section Two (2) of Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945,

As well as all "Macro" 'Recreational Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses also issued under Section Two (2) of Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945 ...

Shall stand on their own legal foundation and, thusly, bear the brunt severally of the competitive winds of the Cannabis industry.

### First Crack

Owners of the current "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses do get "First Crack" at the new "Macro" 'Recreational Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses per Section Two (2), Part Fifteen (15) titled 'Regulation of Marijuana', Paragraph (a) of the new petition language.

### Majority Ownership

Further, the majority (51%) owner of any "micro" Cultivation facility license must be:

a.) an "Economically Disadvantaged Person", or EDP as defined by the State of Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services,

Or,

b.) a Disabled Veteran, or DV as defined by the State of Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services.

### Minimum Cap

There is a "Minimum Cap" on the number of "micro" Cultivation facility licenses that can be issued by the State of Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services.

The "lower" bound of the minimum cap is Six (6) "micro" Cultivation facility licenses per US Federal Legislative District located within the State of Missouri as of the effective date of Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945, or Thirty (30) days after the passage of the petition language on November 6th, 2018.

**Note**. A positive margin of Sixty-Six Percent (66%) of the voters of the Great State of Missouri voted to affirm Section One (1) of Article XIV (14) during the mid-term election of November 6th, 2018, effective December 6th, 2018.

The effective date of Section Two (2) of Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945 shall be Thirty (30) days after the majority vote on November 3, 2020 in favor of the language of the new petition.

And, applications for "micro" Cultivation facility licenses shall thereafter commence on or before December 3rd, 2021 at the discretion of the State of Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services.

### Flowering-stage Plant Limits

If a 'Qualified Medical Patient', or QMP is allowed Nine (9) Flowering-stage plants under a combined Section One (1) and Section Two (2) via an approved, limited 'Authority to Cultivate' ...

And, a "micro" Cultivation facility business owner is allowed One-hundred Fifty (150) Flowering-stage plants under Section Two (2), then how many Flowering-stage plants is a "Macro" licensed Cultivation facility allowed?

**Answer**. Two-thousand Eight-hundred (2,800) Flowering-stage plants or Thirty-thousand (30,000) square feet of Flowering-stage plant canopy.

### Macro Cultivation Facility Expansion

The 'Certification Fee' for a "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility "Expansion Project" that includes an accommodation of the "new" 'Recreational Marijuana' language is Five-thousand ($5,000) USD.

For example, to add an additional Thirty-thousand (30,000) square feet of Flowering-stage plant canopy to an existing "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility for the express purpose of accommodating the "new" 'Recreational Marijuana' Cultivation language ...

A one-time, Non-refundable 'Certification Fee' of Five-thousand ($5,000) USD shall be extracted by the MO Dept of Health and Human Services from the "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility business owner along with the given 'Application To Expand' at the time of 'Recreational' application.

### Letter of Intent

A 'Letter of Intent' may be "Pre-filed" along with the Certification Fee of Five-thousand ($5,000) USD made payable to the Missouri Dept of Health and Human Services by February 21st, 2021 should the language of Section Two (2) indeed pass by a majority of voters at the ballot box on November 3rd, 2020.

### Forfeiture of Recreational Marijuana

Article XIV (14) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945, as contemplated in the proposed Section Two (2), Part Ten (10) titled 'Personal Use of Marijuana', Paragraph Two (2) states ...

Any 'Recreational' person that grows his or her allotment of Three (3) Flowering-stage plants in a visible location, visible by the public through any type of un-aided vision through any type of opening, door, or window shall be subject to a cash fine/civil penalty of no more than $250 USD as well as the FORFEITURE of the person's existing stash of 'Recreational Marijuana' in its entirety.

### Macro Cultivation Application Fees

In Section One (1), Part Three (3). 'Creating Patient Access', Paragraph Eight (8) of the Missouri Constitution of 1945, Article XIV (14), as adopted and effective on December 6th, 2018 ...

The Non-refundable Application fee for a "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility license for years One (1) thru Three (3) of this Section One (1) shall be Ten-thousand ($10,000) USD.

Thereafter, the Non-refundable Application fee for a "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility license drops to Five-thousand ($5,000) USD.

### Macro Cultivation Cultivation Fees

Just like the old chicken-egg farmer over by the Mars gas station on Halls Ferry Rd., a-way back in the '50's ... NOT!

"Macro" licensed Cultivation facility Owners will pay an annual fee to the MO Dept of Health and Human Services of Twenty-thousand ($20,000) cash.

That's right ... The original Section One (1) "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facilities have to pay the State of Missouri Twenty-thousand ($20,000) USD each year just to maintain their license.

Further, "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facilities can only sell their wares to the local Dispensary cartel at wholesale prices.

#### Time Limit

The "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility license allows for Three (3) years of operation before renewal.

**Note**. Applicants were allowed to "Pre-file" their Non-refundable Application fees for One (1) or more "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses starting January 7th, 2019.

#### Annual Fee

There is an annual fee of Twenty-five Thousand ($25,000) USD made payable to the MO Dept of Health and Human Services for all "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facilities.

#### Stay Ahead of the Game

A report performed by the University of Missouri before the election of 2018 stated if the MO Dept of Health and Senior Services licensed at least 26,000 patients, then a total of Twenty-nine (29) "Macro" Cultivation facilities should be able to meet the incoming demand from the QMPs.

As of Monday, the 10th of February, 2020 there were already a total of more than Thirty-three Thousand (33,259) approved, 'Qualified Medical Patients, or QMPs plus a total of Sixty (60) "Macro" Cultivation facilities have already been approved by the MO Dept of Health and Senior Services.

**Note**. The maximum number of "Macro" 'Medical Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses per Ownership entity is Three (3). It is assumed by the language of the petition(s) that the same will hold for "Macro" 'Recreational Marijuana' Cultivation facility licenses, as well.

## Recreational Time Ticking Away

A total of approx. Two-hundred Thousand (200,000) signatures will have to be secured from eligible Missouri voters from the Eight (8) Federal Congressional Districts of Missouri by May 1st, 2020 in order to place the initiative on the ballot during the General Election of November 3rd, 2020.

### Deadline Looming

If placed on the ballot, then at least 50.001% of the voters must vote "Yes".

The effective date of the legislation will be (30) Thirty days after the voting date, or December 3rd, 2020, if passed.
